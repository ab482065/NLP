# Models

This directory contains all the model architectures we used for our experiments. The subdirectories are explained below:
1. `laser-lr`: This subdirectory contains two notebooks for experiments using the LASER + LR model architecture (`laser-lr-mono-multi.ipynb` for monolingual and multilingual scenario experiments `laser-lr-language-family.ipynb` for the language family scenario experiments.)
2. `muse-cnn-gru`: This subdirectory contains a single notebook `muse-cnn-gru.ipynb` that includes experiments for the monolingual, multilingual, and language family experiments.
3. `mbert`: This subdirectory contains three notebooks for experiments using mBERT (`mbert_mono.ipynb` for monolingual scenario experiments, `mbert_multi.ipynb` for multilingual scenario experiments, and `mbert_language_family.ipynb` for language family scenario experiments)
